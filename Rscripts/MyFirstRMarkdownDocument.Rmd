## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Load the ae_attendances data.

#Now work out the proportion (`prop`) of the raw data to assign to the training data:
prop<-(1-(15/nrow(ae)))
#The proportion of the raw that needs to be assigned to the training data to ensure there is only 10 to 15 records in the test data is:

#Partitioning the raw data into the test and training data.

# All records that are in the trainIndex are assigned to the training data.
aeTrain <- ae[ trainIndex,]
nrow(aeTrain)
#There are 12,753 records in my training data. That is a large dataset!

### Now tabulate ae_attendances_ENG training data for my report
aeTrain %>%
  # set the period column to show in Month-Year format
  mutate_at(vars(period), format, "%b-%y") %>% 
  # set the numeric columns to have a comma at the 1000's place
  mutate_at(vars(attendances), comma) %>%
  # show the first 10 rows
  head(10) %>%
  # format as a table
  kable()

## And now save it to the Data folder.  
write_csv(aeTrain, here("Data", "ae_attendances_ENG_train.csv"))  

### Extract the ae_attendances_ENG test data
#All records that are not in the trainIndex (`-trainIndex`) are assigned to the test data.
aeTest  <- ae[-trainIndex,]
nrow(aeTest)

#Set aside the first record from the ae_attendances_ENG test data so that 
#I can test and evaluate my data-capture tool.
aeTestMarker  <- aeTest[1,]

#### Now tabulate ae_attendances_ENG marker test data for my report
aeTestMarker  %>%
  # set the period column to show in Month-Year format
  mutate_at(vars(period), format, "%b-%y") %>% 
  # set the numeric columns to have a comma at the 1000's place
  mutate_at(vars(attendances), comma) %>%
  # show the first 10 rows
  head(10) %>%
  # format as a table
  kable()

### Now to save my ae_attendances_ENG marker test data to my working data folder 'Data'
write_csv(aeTestMarker, here("Data", "ae_attendances_ENG_test_marker.csv"))

### Now set aside the remaining records for me to test (or collect) with my data-capture tool.
aeTest  <- aeTest[2:nrow(aeTest),]

#### Now tabulate ae_attendances_ENG test data for my report
aeTest  %>%
  # set the period column to show in Month-Year format
  mutate_at(vars(period), format, "%b-%y") %>% 
  # set the numeric columns to have a comma at the 1000's place
  mutate_at(vars(attendances), comma) %>%
  # show the first 10 rows
  head(10) %>%
  # format as a table
  kable()

### Now save my ae_attendances_ENG test data to my working data folder 'Data'
write_csv(aeTest, here("Data", "ae_attendances_test.csv"))
